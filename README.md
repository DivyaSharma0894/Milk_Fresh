# MilkFresh - Dairy Products App

MilkFresh is a dairy products app developed using FlutterFlow. It addresses the problem of delayed milk delivery by connecting consumers with local dairy farmers and cooperatives, ensuring the delivery of high-quality, fresh milk directly to their doorstep.

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Presently, the milk supplied to customers, whether acquired through delivery or purchase, predominantly originates from small-scale dairies or prominent industry leaders such as Saras and Amul. Unfortunately, the delivery procedures associated with these suppliers often span a duration of 2-3 days, resulting in a dearth of access to freshly procured milk. Consequently, this lacuna within the milk market has led to customer dissatisfaction regarding the quality of the milk supplied.

### Solution

MilkFresh is designed to solve the problem of delayed milk delivery and provide customers with access to freshly procured milk. It offers a range of features and functionalities, including:

- User registration and verification
- Browsing and selection of local dairy farms
- Placing orders with customization options
- Real-time order tracking
- Secure payment integration
- Subscription plans for regular milk delivery
- Quality assurance and feedback system
- Customer support and promotions
